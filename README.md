# Ki.KD-JVM

This is a [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) implementation of the
[KD (Ki Declarative) language](https://github.com/kixi-io/Ki.Docs/wiki/Ki-Data-(KD)). It
is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) with annotations that allow it to be used
equally well with [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and
other [JVM languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages) such as Scala,
Jython and JRuby.

KD is a simple delcarative language with rich type inferencing and the ability to easily
work with portable high precision numeric and temporal data. It is well suited for
everything from configuration files to financial and scientific applications that require
type safety and precision. See ***[KD Documentation (Wiki)](https://github.com/kixi-io/Ki.Docs/wiki/Ki-Data-(KD))***
